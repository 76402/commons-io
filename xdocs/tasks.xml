        The following are some of the proposed ideas and tasks for commons-io:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A proper user guide.</li>
        <li>FilePoller for telling when a file changes. Look in Tomcat, or GenJava[bayard]</li>
        <li>A "hot folder" handler which triggers an action when a new file has been uploaded to an FTP directory, for example.</li>
        <li>JoinReader/ConcatReader. One in GenJava, one submitted to Bayard</li>
        <li>FormattedWriter, when it writes out values it uses Format objects to output them. </li>
        <li>FixedWidthReader. Reads in files with a known width, ie) mainframe like. </li>
        <li>Add an additional ByteArrayOutputStream variant that saves content
            in memory just as the original but starts to write to a temp file when
            a given number of bytes is surpassed. This is to reduce the memory
            usage for big "things".</li>
        <li>FileUtils could use a copyDirectory() method (possibly making use of IOFileFilters)</li>
        <li>A CsvReader/Writer set of classes in a csv sub-package. Will probably be commons-csv.</li>
        <li>A Finder system. This may becomes commons-finder. </li>
      </ul>
