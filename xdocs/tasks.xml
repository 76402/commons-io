      <p>
        The following action items need to be completed prior to a Version 1.0
        release of this component:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write TestCases for: 
        <ul>
          <li>SwappedDataInputStream - [half done]</li>
        </ul>
        though they may not affect an initial beta release. 
        </li>
        <li>Improve site!!!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following classes will be excluded from the initial release:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>FilenameUtils: This class is still a big mess with many methods not working properly.</li>
        <li>ClassLoaderObjectInputStream: Unless a unit test is written for it in time. </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section name="Post 1.0 release">
      <ul>
        <li>IOUtilsTestCase: Handle unit tests that test an IOUtils method and a CopyUtils method at the same time. </li>
        <li>Write Unit Test for ClassLoaderObjectInputStream. </li>
        <li>FilenameUtils: This class is a big mess ATM. We need to clean it up.</li>
        <li>A CsvReader/Writer set of classes in a csv sub-package</li>
        <li>FilePoller for telling when a file changes. Look in Tomcat, or GenJava[bayard]</li>
        <li>JoinReader/ConcatReader. One in GenJava, one submitted to Bayard</li>
        <li>FormattedWriter, when it writes out values it uses Format objects to output them. </li>
        <li>FixedWidthReader. Reads in files with a known width, ie) mainframe like. </li>
        <li>Finder system. Generic code to find things in things. So FileFinder, 
            ClassFinder, ZipFinder. Probably too big for IO</li>
        <li>Add an additional ByteArrayOutputStream variant that saves content
            in memory just as the original but starts to write to a temp file when
            a given number of bytes is surpassed. This is to reduce the memory
            usage for big "things".</li>
      </ul>

    <section name="Misc.">

          <strong>Integration</strong>. Seek and integrate various i/o related classes.
