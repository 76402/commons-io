			 Commons IO Package
			    Version 1.3
			   Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes for java.io's hierarchy.  
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

Commons IO contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, 
and endian transformation classes.


Compatibility with 1.2
----------------------
Binary compatible - Yes

Source compatible - Yes

Semantic compatible - Yes


Deprecations from 1.2
---------------------
- WildcardFilter deprecated, replaced by WildcardFileFilter
  - old class only accepted files, thus had a confusing dual purpose


Bug fixes from 1.2
------------------
- LineIterator now implements Iterator
  (It was always supposed to...)


Enhancements from 1.2
---------------------
- IOCase
  - New class/enumeration for case-sensitivity control

- FilenameUtils
  - New methods to handle case-sensitivity
  - wildcardMatch - new method that has IOCase as a parameter
  - equals - new method that has IOCase as a parameter

- WildcardFileFilter
  - Replacement for WildcardFilter
  - Accepts both files and directories
  - Ability to control case-sensitivity

- NameFileFilter
  - Ability to control case-sensitivity

- FileFileFilter
  - New IOFileFilter implementation
  - Accepts files where File.isFile() is true
  - In other words it filters out directories

- CanReadFileFilter
  - New IOFileFilter implementation
  - Accepts files where File.canRead() is true

- CanWriteFileFilter
  - New IOFileFilter implementation
  - Accepts files where File.canWrite() is true

- HiddenFileFilter

  - Accepts files where File.isHidden() is true

- EmptyFileFilter
  - New IOFileFilter implementation
  - Accepts files or directories that are empty

- TrueFileFilter/FalseFileFilter/DirectoryFileFilter
  - New singleton instance constants (TRUE/FALSE/DIRECTORY)
  - The new constants are more JDK 1.5 friendly with regards to static imports
    (whereas if everything uses INSTANCE, then they just clash)
  - The old INSTANCE constants are still present and have not been deprecated
